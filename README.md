## Would You Rather App

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

## Project Setup

* Clone the project - https://github.com/supreetharoger/react-udacity-would-you-rather-app
* Install the dependencies - npm install
* Start the development server with npm start

## App Functionality

* The app contains unanswered and answered polling question. Each polling question has a link to the details of the poll and also an option to submit your answer.

The details of poll includes:
* Number of people who voted for that option.
* Percentage of people who voted for that option.

* The app also provides an option to create a new polling question.

* Leaderboard provides details about how many questions the user has asked and answered.
